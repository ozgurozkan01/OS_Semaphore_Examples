    - Broken Finite Buffer Solution !!
    if (items >= bufferSize)
    {
        block();
    }
    
    This implementation does not work properly. Remember that we canâ€™t check the current value of a semaphore
    
    - LOGIC OF RUNNING !!
       Compared to the previous example, this example is more fault tolerant and controlled because we control the buffer occupancy.
    
    - CODE OUTPUT !!
       Same output instance like in infinite producer-consumer problem
