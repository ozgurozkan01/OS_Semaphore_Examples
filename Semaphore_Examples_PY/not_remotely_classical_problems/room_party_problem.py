            - CONSTRAINTS ABOUT PROBLEM !!
                1. Any number of students can be in a room at the same time.
                2. The Dean of Students can only enter a room if there are no students in
                the room (to conduct a search) or if there are more than 50 students in
                the room (to break up the party).
                3. While the Dean of Students is in the room, no additional students may
                enter, but students may leave.
                4. The Dean of Students may not leave the room until all students have left.
                5. There is only one Dean of Students, so you do not have to enforce exclusion
                among multiple deans.

                When the Dean arrives, there are three cases: if there are students in the
                room, but not 50 or more, the Dean has to wait. If there are 50 or more, the
                Dean breaks up the party and waits for the students to leave. If there are no
                students, the Dean searches and leaves.

                In the first two cases, the Dean has to wait for a rendezvous with a student,
                so he has to give up mutex to avoid a deadlock. When the Dean wakes up, he
                has to modify the scoreboard, so he needs to get the mutex back.

                There are three cases where a student might have to signal the Dean. If
                the Dean is waiting, then the 50th student in or the last one out has to signal
                lieIn. If the Dean is in the room (waiting for all the students to leave), the last
                student out signals clear. In all three cases, it is understood that the mutex
                passes from the student to the Dean.

                One part of this solution that may not be obvious is how we know at Deanâ€™s code
                that students must be 0 or not less than 50. The key is to realize that there are
                only two ways to get to this point: either the first conditional was false,
                which means that students is either 0 or not less than 50; or the Dean was waiting on
                lieIn when a student signaled, which means, again, that students is either 0 or not less than 50
